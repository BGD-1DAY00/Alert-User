# Job-Assignment

Instructions for how to run program: 
  - I attempted to build a bot that you communicate with the user, however I was unsuccesfull
  - when you open the page you will receive an alert asking for you first name and last name, it run a cross refernce with the json data, 
    if found you will recieve this message with that users data;
           "Good morning Ethan, and welcome to Hotel California! Room 304 is now ready you. Enjoy your stay, and let us know if you need anything." 
   - If not found the user will recive the alert:
             alert(`Sorry, we don't seem to have your reservation, have you entered your information correctly? Please refresh the page and try again!`);
             
             

Design descisons: 
  - I created form for users to submit compliants and wanted to create a chat box along with it; I couldn't get it to work so I pivioted to the alert system
  - I used a grid display to orient my page and flex for the indivitual components
  - The nav, i used the sticky positioning but none of the links go anywhere, not even youtube
  
  Lanuage: 
    - javscript/node.js
          It is the lanuage I am most comfertable with and I don't know how else to create a page

Verify the Correctness: 
    - I didn't write any test cases, even in my fetch statements I didn't write any try/catch statemets
    - I just ran it alot of times, reflecting on it now i should have done more
    
 What didn't you get to, or what else might you do with more time? 
      - write some test cases
      - make it mobile repsonsive
      - orient the links
      - complete the chatbox
      - redesign the page
     I tried to host the page on heroku; i ran the tail on git bash(windows) and revieced many errors because there were so many packages i was missing:
